/* Offsets
 Offsets are in base 10, so convert your hexadecimal values first.
 Columns are in bases of 16, so digits are multiplied by 16
 and their column placing(indexing at 0) to determine their decimal value.
 So 0x5C3D30 = (5 * (16 * 5)) + (C * (16 * 4)) + (3 * (16 * 3)) + (D * (16 * 2)) + (3 * (16 * 1)) + (0 * (16 * 0)) = 6044976

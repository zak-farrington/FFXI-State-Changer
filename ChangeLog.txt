=======================================================================
Date			Change

10/14/05		* Fixed a error in ReadConfigFile() where comment blocks weren't getting ignored properly
             		  which caused the fgets() loop to continue forever thus the config file contents weren't being
			  read at all.
			* Updated hard coded offsets in cConfig.
			* Updated config file.
			* Set version to v1.1.  No binary updates should be needed due to the *WORKING* config file.
			 

08/18/05		* Added GetSpeed().
			* Added GetSpeedString(). (Once again did the radio button updating in here... bad me.)
			* Added CHECK_SPEED_TIMER.
			* Removed all GUI updating code from the timers and moved it all into
			  UpdateInformation() which can just be called from the timers.
			  Better to do this since I had to update all the info on initalization anyway.
			* Removed PROCESS_VM_WRITE flag from a lot of OpenProcess() calls where
			  writing wasn't involved at all.
			* Increased timer intervalls for less CPU usage... CHECK_STATE_ADDRESS is now running
			  every 3 seconds, but we shouldn't run into a problem since we call CFFXI::GetStateAddress()
			  at program intialization.
			* Regrouped all the radio buttons... sounds easy but it was a pain in teh arse.
			* Added 'About' MessageBox.
			* Updated version info.
			* Ready to go for release.
			* Added debugging protection.
			* Ditched IsDebuggerPresent() and made my own version so it can't be hooked as easily.
			* Just realized I was going open source so all my debugger protections are pointless... oh well.


08/17/05	
			* Changed initialization of CPlayer and CFFXI
			  from dynamic to static for less memory usage.
			* Added configuration file code.
			* Added C-style comments support for configuration file.
			* Renamed sStats structure to sPlayerInfo.
			* Renamed dwNpcMapOffset to dwPcMapOffset(it was a typo).
			* Renamed pFFXI and pPlayer to cFFXI and cPlayer. 
			  They're not pointers anymore anyway.
			* Added strCharacterName and dwCurrentState to sPlayerInfo structure.
			* Added CConfig class.
			* Moved dwPlayerStatsOffset, dwPlayerInfoOffset, dwPcMapOffset,
			  strPolExeName and strFFXIModName to CConfig.
			* Edited the '[:: Error ::]' and '[:: Warning ::]' titles to 
			  '[:: hAx FFXI State Changer: %s ::]'.
			* Renamed strMessage variables to strBuffer, since that's what they were
			  mostly used for anyways.
			* Renamed & moved the strBuffer inside GetStateString() to strStateString
			  inside the CPlayer->sPlayerInfo structure.
			* Added SPEED_X defines.
			* Added ChangeSpeed();
			* Further modified GUI.
			* Added hotkey support.
			* Added user-defined hotkey support.
			* Edited all radio buttons to make sure they prefix either IDC_STATE_* or IDC_SPEED_*.
			* State radio buttons now update to your current state, even if it's modified in game
			  rather than the program itself. (Inserted into GetStateString()... not really where
			  it should belong but I'm rushing, I gotta make a release in two days.)
			* Changed all the SetWindowText() and GetWindowText() calls to SetDlgItemText() and
			  GetDlgItemText() like it should've been the first time around.


08/16/05	
			* Added memory leak detection for debugging.
			* Fixed miscellaneous memory leaks.


08/14/05	
			* Implemented the use of classes and created CFFXI and CPlayer.
			* Added GetTNL().
			* Added GetName().
			* Added GetState().
			* Added GetStateAddress().
			* Added GetStateString().
			* Optimized compiler and linker for smaller binary size on 'Release'.


08/13/05	
			* Released Beta 1.
			* Added WriteLog() for help with debugging.
			* Removed InjectCode() method of and now we locate
			  the state address via the PC/NPC map.
			* Added GetStateString().
			* Released Beta 2.


08/11/05	
			* Revamped GUI.
			* Added a new banner.
			* Added timers to read TNL, name, state address, and current state.
				

08/08/05	
			* Got bored and decided to pick up the project again and improve it monumentally.
			* Removed old Scan() method and added InjectCode() method.
			* Added ChangeState().
			* Removed old FindWindow() method of locating FFXI process
			  and added CreateToolhelp32Snapshot() method.
			* Added code to determine the FFXiMain.dll base address.


07/18/05	
			* First started and finished a crappy and very unefficent program.
			* Quit project due to lack of interest.
